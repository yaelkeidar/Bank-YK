# Bank-YK
In the project, I created a bank system in Python.
The system demonstrates w real working bank website with several options-
1. Creating an account
2. Transfer money
3. Opening savings account
4. Taking a loan
5. Booking an appointment with a banker
This project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles along with the powerful data manipulation capabilities of pandas, a Python Data Analysis Library, to efficiently manage and process data, including data stored in Excel and text files.
